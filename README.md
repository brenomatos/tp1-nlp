# Word2vec
Code regarding the first assignment of Natural Language Processing class @ UFMG. The assignment was to create and test various word2vec models, varying parameters like corpus size, use of skip-gram or CBOW algorithm and context window.

## Getting Started
### Files Needed
Is this assignment, we used the Matt Mahoney's [text8]( http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip) to train our models. To evaluate them, we used Google's [questions-words.txt](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/source/default/source).


### Running the Code
First of all, you may need to run this code snippet if it's the first time you use the nltk library
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

Then, clone this repository.
